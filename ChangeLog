	* CMakeModules/FindCOLLADA.cmake,
	  src/osgPlugins/dae/daeRMaterials.cpp: From Roland Smeenk,
	  "Attached are two small fixes:
	  -I changed the SET of COLLADA_BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR to use findpath,
	  so users may override this setting if they choose not to build
	  against to precompiled boost libraries delivered with the Collada
	  DOM.
	  
	  -Changed daeRMaterials.cpp to prevent a compiler warning about a
	  potentially uninitialized variable."

	  of the ScopedLock<Mutex> template

2009-02-09 21:53  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osg/ReaderWriterOSG.cpp: From Bryan Thrall, "The
	  .osg plugin doesn't seem to support an option to write shader
	  files
	  separately, so it always inlines them in the .osg file (as far as
	  I can
	  tell). This change adds that ability. "
	  
	  Merged from svn/trunk.

2009-02-09 21:17  robert

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp: From Ralf Habacker, "on
	  win32 there is a memory leak in recent svn code in
	  GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp.
	  
	  in bool GraphicsWindowWin32::setWindow( HWND handle )
	  
	  there is the following if/else statement
	  
	  if (_traits.valid() && _traits->setInheritedWindowPixelFormat)
	  ....
	  else
	  setPixelFormat()
	  _hglrc = ::wglCreateContext(...) [1]
	  
	  setPixelFormat() calls wglCreateContext() and saves the result
	  into _hglrc which is overwritten by a second call to
	  wglCreateContext() call at [1]
	  
	  The same behavior occurs in bool
	  Win32WindowingSystem::getSampleOpenGLContext( OpenGLContext&
	  context, HDC windowHDC, int windowOriginX, int windowOriginY ).
	  
	  The solution for this issue is to move the wglCreateContext() out
	  of setPixelFormat() and to place it into the caller which is done
	  to the appended file
	  "

2009-02-09 18:20  robert

	* include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem,
	  src/osgParticle/ConnectedParticleSystem.cpp,
	  src/osgParticle/ParticleProcessor.cpp,
	  src/osgParticle/ParticleSystem.cpp,
	  src/osgParticle/ParticleSystemUpdater.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgParticle/ParticleSystem.cpp: To address a
	  thread related crash reported in osgParticle changed the
	  ParticleSystem
	  to have an optional compile path for either using a
	  OpenThreads::ReadWriteMutex or an
	  OpenThreads::Mutex as it's base implementation, with the Mutex
	  now being used by default.

2009-02-08 15:56  robert

	* examples/osgcompositeviewer/osgcompositeviewer.cpp,
	  examples/osgfont/osgfont.cpp, examples/osgmovie/osgmovie.cpp,
	  examples/osgocclusionquery/osgocclusionquery.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/DynamicLibrary.cpp: Form Paul Melis, "While trying out
	  the osgbrowser example (where I had forgotten to update
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the XUL libs would be found) I noticed that
	  although
	  the gecko plugin was found it could not be loaded. But this did
	  not
	  trigger any visible warning/error message (at least not without
	  INFO
	  notify level). Would you mind if we change the notify level for a
	  dlerror() to WARNING? This will also make it more explicit for
	  the case
	  when a plugin isn't actually found, which seems to come up a lot
	  for
	  novice users (e.g. no freetype on win32, so no freetype plugin,
	  etc).
	  Also, the current error message is misleading ("Warning: Could
	  not FIND
	  plugin to ...") because the it's not always a case of not finding
	  the
	  plugin. I slightly enhanced the situation of not finding a plugin
	  versus
	  finding it but not being able to load it.
	  
	  Here's also a few fixes to some of the examples:
	  - osgfont: make usage help line more in line with the actual
	  behaviour
	  - osgcompositeviewer: complain when no model file was provided
	  - osgmovie: don't include quicktime-dependent feature on Linux
	  - osgocclussionquery: comment addition (as I was surprised that
	  lines
	  were being drawn in a function called createRandomTriangles())"

2009-02-07 11:28  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Added merge.setting of StateSet during
	  replacement of Transforms in FlattenStaticTransfrom and

	  src/osgPlugins/dicom/ReaderWriterDICOM.cpp,

	  src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: From Alberto Luaces, "here are some
	  minor fixes to notify warnings were the std::hex modifier was
	  used but never restored to the decimal notation. That made OSG
	  print messages
	  like the following after some notifications:
	  
	  Warning: detected OpenGL error 'invalid value' after
	  RenderBin::draw(,)
	  RenderStage::drawInner(,) FBO status= 0x8cd5
	  [...]
	  Scaling image 'brick_side.JPG' from (1b4,24f) to (200,200) <---

2009-02-06 10:12  robert

	* include/osgAnimation/Animation,
	  include/osgAnimation/BasicAnimationManager,
	  src/osgAnimation/BasicAnimationManager.cpp,
	  src/osgAnimation/CMakeLists.txt: From Fabien Lavignotte, "Here is
	  some various small fixes i have done while playing with
	  osgAnimation.
	  - Animation : removed the _name attribute that is never used.
	  - BasicAnimationManager : fix a crash on Windows with the example
	  osganimationviewer. The _lastUpdate attribute was not initialized
	  when

2009-02-05 14:34  robert

	* examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp: From Morne Pistorius,
	  "Attached is a modified version of the QOSGWidget example that
	  shows
	  the workaround we discussed for adding/removing views in a
	  composite
	  viewer at runtime. A dummy view is added to the viewer to always
	  keep
	  it live.
	  
	  Also, I added a #define to the Qt event relay methods to not
	  override
	  them on a Windows system. This fixes the bug where duplicate
	  events
	  are being sent and making it impossible to throw the trackball."

2009-02-05 12:03  robert

	* examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp: Warning fixes

2009-02-05 11:06  robert
